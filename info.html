                    I have been studying fashion in Japan since 2020 because I like Japanese designer brands.<br>
                    I am majoring in fashion marketing and studying sociology of fashion at university.<br>
                    I started to be interested in programming from fashion tech and e-commerce sites, and I am studying a little<br> on my own.</p>

                    <p class="keyword-exp">After graduating from high school, I studied Japanese on my own for a year and obtained N1, the highest level on the JLPT. And I am often told that my Japanese pronunciation is natural. In fact, I am so confident in my Japanese that they don't even know I am Korean unless I tell them myself! I also do volunteer work as an interpreter and translator between Korean and Japanese.</p>

                    <h4 class="keyword-name">passionate</h4>
                    <p class="keyword-exp">I have tried many things since I was a child. I played piano from the age of 3 to 18 and was actually good enough to go to music college. While playing piano, I also played sports such as soccer, softball, and boxing. I also loved fashion, which is why I am now studying in Japan, and I am now taking on a new challenge as I have shifted my interest from fashion to programming.</p>

                    <h4 class="keyword-name">competitive</h4>
                    <p class="keyword-exp">I said I have done many things, and I think the reason I have been able to do them is because I hate to lose. I also play the piano because I always say to myself, "I will be better than him! When I played sports, I always had the idea that I would win. In fact, I started studying Japanese after seeing my brother get his N2. In college, when I was doing group assignments, I worked hard thinking that I would definitely get first place in this group, and I really received the best grade. The reason I started this study was because I thought that if I had the skills, I could make something better than this.</p>
